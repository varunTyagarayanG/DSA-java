# Explanation: Generate Parentheses Logic

## Problem Statement
The task is to generate all combinations of `n` pairs of balanced parentheses. For example, given `n = 3`, the valid combinations are:
- `((()))`
- `(()())`
- `(())()`
- `()(())`
- `()()()`

## Approach

### 1. Recursive Function
The solution uses a recursive function to build the parentheses combinations. The key idea is to keep track of the number of open `(` and close `)` brackets used so far and ensure that the parentheses are balanced.

### 2. Base Case
The base case of the recursion occurs when the total number of open and close parentheses equals `2 * n`, meaning all pairs of parentheses have been used. If the number of open and close parentheses are equal at this point, the current combination is valid and added to the result list.

### 3. Recursive Steps
- **Adding an Open Parenthesis `(`:** 
  - If the number of open parentheses used so far is less than `n`, you can add another open parenthesis and make a recursive call. This ensures that you don't exceed the number of open parentheses allowed.
  
- **Adding a Close Parenthesis `)`**:
  - You can add a close parenthesis only if the number of close parentheses is less than the number of open parentheses. This ensures that the resulting string is always balanced.

### 4. Backtracking
The function backtracks by recursively exploring all possibilities of adding open or close parentheses at each step until all valid combinations are found.

### 5. Handling Edge Cases
- If `n = 0`, the output should be an empty list since there are no parentheses to generate.
- The code also handles cases where `n` is negative by ensuring that the input is treated correctly to avoid invalid operations.

## Example Walkthrough
For `n = 2`, the recursive function will generate the following steps:
1. Start with an empty string `""` and 0 open, 0 close.
2. Add an open parenthesis: `"("`, 1 open, 0 close.
3. Add another open parenthesis: `"(("`, 2 open, 0 close.
4. Now only close parentheses can be added: `"(()"`, 2 open, 1 close.
5. Finally, add the last close parenthesis: `"(())"`, 2 open, 2 close (valid combination).

The same process is repeated for all other combinations.

## Conclusion
This approach efficiently generates all valid combinations of parentheses by using a recursive backtracking method. The code ensures that the resulting strings are balanced and include exactly `n` pairs of parentheses.

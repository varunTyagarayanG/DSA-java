# Explanation: Power Calculation Logic (`MyPow` Class)

## Problem Statement
The objective is to calculate `x` raised to the power of `n` (i.e., `x^n`) efficiently. The solution should handle both positive and negative values of `n`.

## Approach

### 1. Divide and Conquer Method
The core of this solution relies on the divide and conquer strategy. Instead of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times, the algorithm splits the problem into smaller subproblems, significantly reducing the number of operations needed.

### 2. Recursive Function `func`
The function `func(x, n)` is designed to compute `x^n` using the following steps:
- **Base Case:** 
  - If `n == 0`, return `1`. This is because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
  
- **Divide the Problem:**
  - The function recursively calculates `x^(n/2)` and stores it in `half`. By doing so, it splits the problem in half with each recursive call.
  
- **Combine the Results:**
  - If `n` is even, the result is simply `half * half`, since `x^n` can be represented as `(x^(n/2))^2`.
  - If `n` is odd, an additional multiplication by `x` is needed, so the result becomes `half * half * x`.

### 3. Handling Negative Powers
The `solution` method first checks if `n` is negative:
- If `n` is negative, the problem is converted into calculating the positive power of `1/x`. This is because `x^(-n)` is equivalent to `(1/x)^n`.
- The value of `n` is then converted to a positive integer to reuse the same recursive function.

### 4. Efficiency
The divide and conquer approach ensures that the time complexity of the solution is `O(log n)`, making it much more efficient than the naive approach of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times (`O(n)`).

### 5. Example Walkthrough
- **Example 1: `x = 2.0`, `n = 10`**
  - The function recursively computes `2^10` by first computing `2^5`, and further down to `2^2`, and so on. It then combines these results to return `1024.0`.
  
- **Example 2: `x = 2.0`, `n = -2`**
  - The function converts this to calculating `(1/2)^2`, resulting in `0.25`.

## Conclusion
This approach is highly efficient for computing powers of a number, especially for large values of `n`. It uses recursion and the divide and conquer strategy to minimize the number of multiplications required, making it well-suited for both positive and negative exponents.
